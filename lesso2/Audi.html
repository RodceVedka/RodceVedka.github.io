          <h3>What is the importance of meteorology on aviation?</h3>

           <p>Meteorological services help the aviation industry to reduce flight
             times, and fuel consumption. Weather change is increasingly, and it is 
              taken into account in long-term planning because of it can
               influence air travel demand and destination choice.</p>
            <p>An example of this are flights at high temperatures, as the temperature is higher,
                 the air expands and has less density. It is thinner.
                That lower density reduces the amount of lift that is generated in the wings
                 of an airplane, knowing that there is an upward temperature change,
                 forecast from meteorological area helps them to make decition on their flights.</p>

        <p>The weather directly affects livestock activity by acting on the productive physiology
            of the animal (milk, meat, eggs, hair, feathers) and indirectly by affecting forage development,
            fluctuation of the parasitic population, the microenvironment of the reception establishments of
            the storage of animals and food and the product marketing process.
            In our tropical conditions (Costa Rica), temperature and precipitation are the elements
            most determining meteorological factors in the effect that the weather produces in the animals of uses
